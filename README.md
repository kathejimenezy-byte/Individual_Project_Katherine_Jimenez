### Data Analysis Project (1960–2023)

This repository contains the code, figures, and report for a data science project analyzing the relationship between economic development, CO₂ emissions, and global temperature anomalies.

Project Overview
The project explores four main questions:
1. How strongly GDP per capita and CO₂ per capita are related.
2. Whether GDP per capita can predict CO₂ per capita.
3. Whether selected countries exhibit an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).
4. Whether global CO₂ emissions predict global temperature anomalies.

Methods
- **Correlation Analysis:** Annual GDP–CO₂ correlations from 1820–2023.  
- **Power-Law Regression:** Log–log modeling of CO₂ per capita vs GDP per capita.  
- **EKC Modeling:** Quadratic regressions for six countries at different income levels.  
- **Climate Regression:** Linear model relating global CO₂ emissions to global temperature anomalies.
